# Hello World!
This is the beginning of my humble blog that will detail my journey through
learning programming. I decided to write this blog for two main reasons. First,
I often struggle finding resources about what I'm trying to write. Often-times
I find my solutions by cobbling together poorly copy-pasta'd Stack Overflow answers,
only to find that there were much more elegant solutions hiding in the

## React Native tutorial

Install Android (API 21) through homebrew

https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html

open emulator using the command ```emulator -avd reactnative```

install on device using ```react-native run-android```

android sdk management through the command ```android```

alter the emulated device by typing ```android avd```

if bundle is not loading, sometimes you have to switch what the emulator is pointing to for localhost. To do this,start the emulator and run ```adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081```. You can then run the ```react-native run-android``` command. In order to check if this worked, you can go to ```http://localhost:8081/```. If you get a message reading "Cannot get /", you probably did it right!
