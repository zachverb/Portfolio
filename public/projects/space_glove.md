A global finalist for the NASA sanctioned hackathon, Space Apps. Space Apps is a global hackathon in which teams create hardware and software based on a number of challenges in order to inspire real-life technology and design for the future. We created a glove that would allow for control of a space suit. This glove would interface with the space suit's Heads Up Display (HUD) in order to control an Astronauts jet pack, communicate with an on-board computer via Speech to Text, and display the suit's current statistics involving oxygen levels, battery life, and more.

To create this application, we made an Android application that would sync data via Firebase. It would use the phone's built in Accelerometer and Gyroscope to control the Jetpack functions, and send signals based on the users input. This would control a web application that would read the data stored via Firebase. The web application utilized Three.js to display a user in space. It would mimic a users movement through space via the input from the Gyroscope and Accelerometer. It also had a menu that a user could access through the space glove.
