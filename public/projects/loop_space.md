Designed and developed an Android application for Cloud-Based audio collaboration through short audio loops. Created an account system that allows users to create tracks and collaborate with others in order to improve their musical abilities. Users find tracks created by nearby users and add their own loops. Created a comment system in order to develop communication between users to enhance the collaborative environment. Created a REST API using Express on Node.js hosted on AWS EC2 with a PostgreSQL database, as well as AWS S3 for audio storage. Uses Nginx for reverse proxying and load-balancing. Currently in the process of refining the app before pushing a beta to the app store.

The app is focused on creating a community of musicians that are looking to collaborate with others instantaneously. Currently, there isn't a platform for this spontaneous creation. The goal to give users a platform in which they can express their ideas and grow as musicians.
