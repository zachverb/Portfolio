In October 2014, I participated in Dubhacks, the largest hackathon in the Pacific Northwest.

I spent my time creating a synthesizer using the Leap Motion API and the Web Audio API. 

This was my first experience using the Leap Motion API, but as I read through documentation and became familiar with the functions I quickly mapped them to useful features in the synthesizer.
Oscl8r is a project thinking about music creation for the future - focusing on hand gestures to change the pitch, oscillation, and vibrato to effect synthesizer and drum sounds. We wanted to allow users to have a more engaging and immersive environment in which they can create music easily without being tied down to a mouse and keyboard.
