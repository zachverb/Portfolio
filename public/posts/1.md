# Hello World!

```
() => {
  console.log("Hello world!");
}
```

Here's my canonical 'Hello World' post that all tech bloggers cleverly write. I'm not much of a writer, but I plan on writing series of tutorials on some of the things I have been creating, ranging from Redux and React Native to Android and Audio development. I am a recent college grad from the University of Washington currently working as a Software Engineer at Uber. While I don't have the most free time in the world, when I do have it I love playing around with a lot of the more fun and exciting web technologies.

I love the creative aspect of programming. I love the power of the web. My goal is to be able to develop clean and fun interactive music websites that the world can use!
